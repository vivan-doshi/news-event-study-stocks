(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\\'s program is being recorded.\\r\\nAnd now I\\'d like to introduce your host for today\\'s program, Jen Gaumond, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJennifer Gaumond\\n\\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today\\'s conference call to discuss Jamf\\'s fourth quarter and full year financial results. With me on today\\'s call are Dean Hager, Chief Executive Officer; Ian Goodkind, Chief Financial Officer; and John Strosahl, President and Chief Operating Officer.\\r\\nBefore we begin, I\\'d like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year financial results. We also published our Q4 earnings presentation, along with an updated investor presentation and Excel file containing quarterly financial statements to assist with modeling. You may access the summation on the Investor Relations section of jamf.com. \\r\\nToday\\'s discussion may include forward-looking statements. Please refer to our most recent SEC reports, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, where you will see a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. I would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to Jamf\\'s performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. \\r\\nAdditionally, to ensure we can address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 initial question and 1 follow-up.\\r\\nNow I\\'d like to turn the call over to Dean Hager. Dean?\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nThank you, Jen, and to everyone for joining us. 2022 was a year of milestones for Jamf as we continued to deliver outstanding solutions for our customers and fulfill our mission to help organizations succeed with Apple.\\r\\nWe finished the year serving over 71,000 customers, helping them navigate the challenges and opportunities in today\\'s hybrid work world by protecting their organizations while empowering their people with the legendary Apple consumer simple user experience. \\r\\nWe are pleased to report for the 11th consecutive quarter, Jamf again exceeded expectations in Q4, with year-over-year revenue growth of 26%, resulting in full year 2022 revenue growth of 31%. We completed the year with 30 million paid devices on our platform, which is remarkable considering we celebrated reaching 20 million devices just 2 years ago.\\r\\nIn 2022, Jamf also achieved the largest year-over-year Mac device growth in our history for the first time achieving a net addition of over 1 million Macs under management in just 1 year. During 2022, we significantly enhanced our market-leading platform for managing and securing Apple at Work.\\r\\nJamf\\'s product leadership and continued execution helped Jamf surpass the $500 million ARR mark at the end of Q4, now with over $400 million of device management ARR and over $100 million of ARR from our security solutions, a business that has been almost entirely created in the past 3 years.\\r\\nJamf\\'s success in Q4 and throughout 2022 is even more remarkable, considering the difficult macro environment. We talked last quarter about device supply chain issues and the challenges we faced recruiting sales talent from earlier in the year.\\r\\nAdditionally, in Q3, we highlighted that muted customer hiring expectations and layoffs resulted in lower device growth at renewal, which continued in Q4, normally Jamf\\'s highest quarter for commercial customer renewals. Fortunately, Jamf is well positioned for market challenges, having historically approached growth responsibly and profitably.\\r\\nLast quarter, I explained that because of the challenging hiring environment through most of 2022, we chose to staff short of our new employee onboarding plans for the year. Jamf\\'s prudent approach to compensation and hiring in 2022, along with additional targeted expense actions we took in Q4, led us to exceeding expectations for both non-GAAP operating income and unlevered free cash flow. \\r\\nAdditionally, due to our targeted recruiting late in 2022, we were able to achieve our year-end sales headcount goals. We expect these reps will ramp to full productivity in time to meet anticipated demand in the latter part of 2023.\\r\\nWe were able to accomplish this balance of slower investment growth with targeted additions while still achieving 90% voluntary employee retention for the full year. We believe the cost measures we put in place, which Ian will provide more detail on later, combined with an expanded differentiated product line and targeted growth in sales headcount, will help us achieve strong bottom line results while positioning Jamf for future growth.\\r\\nDespite the challenges the market presents, in many ways, 2022 showed us that Jamf\\'s market and company fundamentals are as strong as ever. Specifically, I would like to comment further on our view of the market, customer acquisition and retention, device growth and cross-selling of our security solutions.\\r\\nFirst, I\\'ll address the market. 2022 was not a good year for PC shipments, declining 17% compared to 2021, according to IDC. However, both Mac and iPad shipments grew in 2022, while iPhone grew in market share, overtaking Android in the United States.\\r\\nSpecifically regarding the Mac, IDC reports show Mac has significantly outgrown the rest of the PC industry for the past 3 years, shipping 60% more Mac in 2022 than in 2019, while all other PCs only shipped 6% more over the same period.\\r\\nIn 2022, Mac reached double-digit market share globally for the first time. And according to Gartner, Mac shipments reached 17% market share in the United States in Q4, 3 points higher than prior year.\\r\\nThe expanding Mac market share and continued innovation by Apple bodes well for Jamf\\'s total addressable market and long-term growth as we continue to set the standard for managing and securing Mac at work. Regarding customer acquisition and retention, in Q4, Jamf grew its installed base by more than 2,000 customers, resulting in 11,000 active customers added for the full year.\\r\\nJamf\\'s overall gross and loss-only retention rate for the trailing 12 months at the end of 2022 remain above pre-pandemic levels and were approximately the same as the prior year. As typical in a challenging macro environment, churn is greatest at the low end of the market. In particular, with solutions like Jamf Now, designed specifically for small businesses with the convenience of monthly renewals.\\r\\nHistorically, the SMB market has been the quickest to react to market downturns but also the quickest to rebound. From an ARR perspective, the small business market is Jamf\\'s largest and fastest-growing commercial segment, represented by companies with fewer than 1,000 employees.\\r\\nAdditionally, Jamf\\'s emerging MSP channel serves many small businesses and is growing faster than Jamf\\'s direct routes to market. These customers, served by our MSP partners, are largely additive to Jamf\\'s total of 71,000 customers.\\r\\nJamf\\'s customer loyalty at the high end of the market continues to be world-class. Of Jamf\\'s largest 100 customers measured by ARR at the beginning of 2022, Jamf retained 100% of them. And all of Jamf\\'s top 25 customers grew their annual contract value with Jamf in 2022.\\r\\nThe most pressing challenge Jamf has seen over the past 2 quarters has been in device count growth. Although our top 25 customers all grew with Jamf 2022, the rate of device growth has been significantly slowed by changes in the employment market and customer tendency to purchase seats only for their current headcount and not for anticipated growth as we\\'ve seen historically.\\r\\nThis is true, both for customer renewals and new logos. Although device count is negatively impacted during periods of slower employee growth, history tells us that device expansion typically rebounds quickly as market dynamics improve.\\r\\nFortunately, Jamf\\'s business has transformed since going public in 2020 and now includes several other vectors of growth beyond device expansion. Jamf\\'s collection of security products now constitute over $100 million of our ARR, equaling 49% growth year-over-year. The number of customers running both a Jamf\\'s management and security solutions has grown to over 13,500, which is over 1,000 more customers than just 1 quarter ago.\\r\\nThis helps drive positive improvements to Jamf\\'s ARR per device, which as of Q4 is now over $17, an increase of $3 in the past 2 years. Jamf\\'s commitment to expand and enhance our platform through innovation, acquisitions and partnerships is critical in the accomplishment of our mission to help organizations succeed with Apple, and position Jamf for growth in 2023 and beyond.\\r\\nI\\'ll now hand things over to John to highlight areas of Jamf\\'s market momentum and Q4 wins. John?\\n\\nJohn Strosahl\\n\\nThanks, Dean. In Q4, Jamf took significant strides in expanding our platform, partnering with industry influencers and executing our strategy to manage and secure Apple at Work.\\r\\nIn November, we completed our acquisition of ZecOps. This new mobile security capability is extremely unique in the industry and will allow Jamf to identify sophisticated attacks that target high-profile individuals who have access to the most sensitive organizational data.\\r\\nWith this technology, Jamf aims to bring iOS security and visibility up to the standard we\\'ve already set with Jamf Protect for Mac. We also continue to enhance our relationship with key industry influencing partners for both our management and security solutions. With several new Q4 product deliveries, Jamf is the only Apple-first management and security solution integrated with Zero trust network access, or ZTNA, frameworks for all 3 of the largest cloud providers, Microsoft, Google and AWS. \\r\\nJamf\\'s collaboration, specifically with AWS, is noteworthy. At JNUC in September, we announced that Jamf is the only management solution capable of managing virtual EC2 Macs. Then in Q4, in addition to our ZTNA announcement supporting AWS Verified Access, Jamf joined AWS\\' ISV Accelerate program.\\r\\nAs a result of this partnership, Jamf is included in the AWS marketplace, AWS and Jamf sales teams collaborate to best serve customers, AWS sales teams are incentivized to sell Jamf products, and customers can use their AWS credits or committed annual spend to purchase Jamf products.\\r\\nOne example of immediate benefit from Jamf\\'s AWS marketplace listing was with long-time Jamf customer Allegiant Airlines. Allegiant utilizes Jamf for iOS devices in all parts of their flight operations and have more than doubled its iOS fleet over the past year. In Q4, the Jamf team partnered with AWS team to facilitate Allegiant\\'s renewal, growth and cloud migration using annual committed AWS spend, providing financial benefit for our joint customer and significantly streamlining the procurement process.\\r\\nAs we look into 2023, we are cautious given the market dynamics, but remain optimistic. Our total addressable market continues to expand and our customer loyalty and market leadership remain strong. I\\'d like to quickly highlight 4 areas that illustrates Jamf\\'s significant market leadership and continued opportunity.\\r\\nFirst, in education market, Jamf continues to be the market leader, now empowering an estimated 40 million students globally, serving 8 of the top 10 school districts in the U.S. and some of the largest government education deployments around the world, including Japan, Taiwan, Germany and Australia.\\r\\nIn July of 2022, Jamf launched a brand-new solution for schools, Jamf Safe Internet. Last quarter, we told you that Jamf Safe Internet was the most successful product launch in Jamf\\'s history, measured by sales in the first quarter of availability.\\r\\nEven though Q4 is not traditionally a buying quarter for schools, momentum of Jamf Safe Internet continued. In Q4, Jamf upsold customers in all major geographies with thousands of Safe Internet seats. We finished 2022 with over 400 customers having selected Jamf Safe Internet in its first 6 months of availability. And now that we have extended Jamf Safe Internet support to also include Google Chromebooks, we are excited to reach customers at an accelerated rate and protect more students as we approach spring and schools prepare for the next academic year.\\r\\nAnother market where Jamf is the clear leader is Mac at work. Jamf currently serves 22 of the top 25 global brands and 9 of the top 10 largest companies. If Mac market share continues to expand as it in 2022, we believe Jamf\\'s leadership position and robust complement of management and security solutions will provide a substantial growth driver long into the future.\\r\\nAs Dean stated earlier, Jamf continues to grow its Mac footprint, adding over 1 million Mac under management in 2022. One example of growth was long-time Jamf customer, Cisco, who renewed their contract with Jamf in Q4, increasing their Mac seat count by 20%.\\r\\nAccording to Cisco, the key component of this growth has been user preference for Mac, with 59% of new employees choosing Mac. Expanding our Mac presence to also include iPad and iPhone management is Jamf\\'s fastest-growing segment by device count.\\r\\nIn 2022, Jamf expanded our product support to provide unique value for both corporate and personally owned mobile devices. This, combined with market consolidation in the legacy mobile device management market, has created an emerging replacement market for Jamf.\\r\\nIn Q4 alone, Jamf replaced 10 different customer implementations of at least 1,000 Apple devices for just 1 of our competitors. In 9 of these 10 customers, the win was driven by both iPhone and iPad seats. One of Jamf\\'s greatest strength is our unique capability to support shared and one-to-one iPad and iPhones for the purpose of industry transformation. \\r\\nIn health care, Jamf supports more than 1 million Apple devices, with 5 new wins in Q4 alone for at least 1,000 iPhones and iPads supporting industry workflows like patient bedside, clinical communications and home care.\\r\\nAnother promising industry where Jamf is rapidly establishing market leadership is transportation. At JNUC in September, American Airlines shared their success using Jamf to deploy 80,000 iPhones and iPads. In Q4, Jamf had 5 additional airline wins with at least 1,000 mobile devices to be used for flight-specific use cases like electronic flight bags for pilots and workflows for mechanics, flight attendants and travelers.\\r\\nConsidering the size of the mobile market, the strength of Jamf\\'s solution and the disruption in the legacy unified device management market, we are bullish regarding Jamf\\'s long-term growth trajectory as we anticipate more organizations will align their management and security requirements with an Apple-first solution.\\r\\nThe final opportunity I\\'ll address is Jamf\\'s combination of our industry-leading management solution with our emerging security products, which we believe uniquely positions Jamf to offer the only complete solution that ensures all work access from both corporate and personal Apple devices is trusted.\\r\\nJamf\\'s capability has been built over the past 3 years with organic development and several acquisitions. In total, Jamf has acquired less than $30 million of security ARR. Yet, as discussed earlier, Jamf\\'s security ARR in Q4 has now reached over $100 million, growing at year-over-year at 49%.\\r\\nWe believe we are still in the early stages of growing our security solution and will only get stronger and more efficient as we achieve scale and continue to integrate our products into a single platform.\\r\\nA win that showcases our expanding total addressable market is with The Global Media Company. This long time Jamf Pro customer first expanded to our security solution in December of 2020, then to Jamf\\'s business plan in December of 2021. And in December of 2022, they expanded their Jamf threat prevention implementation from Apple-only to also include their Microsoft Windows devices.\\r\\nJamf\\'s strength in Apple device management has set the stage for continued product cross-sell and upsell opportunities that create greater customer value and device expansion for all types of Apple devices and beyond.\\r\\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it over to Ian.\\n\\nIan Goodkind\\n\\nThanks, John. We ended Q4 with revenue growth of 26% year-over-year, resulting in fiscal year revenue growth of 31%. Total ARR surpassed the $500 million mark, growing 24% year-over-year to $512.5 million.\\r\\nWe continue to see balanced growth across the many facets of our business, including management and security, commercial and education, major geographies, top commercial industries, channel and strategic partners and size of enterprise, with many milestones along the way.\\r\\nAs a reminder, our ARR is calculated using an exchange rate estimate for the fiscal year that has held constant throughout the year. If we were to report ARR in actual currency, the impact to 2022 would be immaterial. We saw a decline in total company net retention rate to 113% in Q4, primarily due to continued muted customer hiring expectations that are impacting device growth at renewal as well as increased churn at the low end of the market.\\r\\nWe believe these declines are temporary and are primarily driven by the difficult macro environment, and we would expect this metric to increase as macro conditions improve. The remainder of my remarks on margins, expense items and profitability will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP financial results, along with the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP, are found in the earnings release. \\r\\nQ4 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 82% and within our expectations. We continue to anticipate gross margins in the low 80% range and expect slight fluctuations each quarter. We improved non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 over the prior year, resulting in Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 7% due to revenue outperformance and proactive cost containment initiatives. Our trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow margin was 18%, which was flat to the prior year. This result exceeds the expectations we established in Q3, primarily driven by increased collections in Q4.\\r\\nOur annual effective tax rate is 0.2%, consistent with our expectations. As a reminder, starting with Q1 2022 for non-GAAP metrics, we will use our domestic statutory rate for calculating tax impacts, which is currently 24%. We have included calculations using this updated methodology for current and prior periods in the Excel file containing our quarterly financial statements that has been posted to our IR website. Please note that we pay a negligible amount of cash taxes on a U.S. federal basis and pay an immaterial amount of cash taxes outside the U.S.\\r\\nNow turning to 2023. As we continue to navigate the difficult macro environment, we have taken a number of cost initiatives to ensure maximum flexibility and stability for our business in 2023. We slowed our hiring in all areas except sales in the second half of 2022 while accelerating sales onboarding to ensure we have enough fully ramped quota-bearing reps to meet anticipated demand in the second half of 2023.\\r\\nThese actions resulted in lower-than-expected headcount expense. Additionally, in Q4, we enacted other cost initiatives in categories such as travel and discretionary spend. As a result, these cost savings, when combined with our revenue outperformance helped us exceed expectations for both non-GAAP operating income and unlevered free cash flow in Q4.\\r\\nAdditionally, given we are prudent and therefore, short of our hiring goals, we believe we are in a fortunate position compared to other technology companies that may have overhired and overspent in 2022. Now for 2023, we are being more aggressive on headcount management, given it\\'s our largest expense, by eliminating noncritical hiring and work, increasing focus on performance management and reviewing all backfills.\\r\\nAs such, we anticipate ending 2023 with headcount at or below current levels. Outside of headcount, we are working with budget owners to identify and execute cost savings. We\\'re reducing our facility footprint, evaluating all software spend and ensuring we spend only on value-added activities.\\r\\nThese activities include investing in projects that will further reduce our cost structure in the future and provide scalability and increased operational excellence. Jamf has historically operated in a prudent manner with respect to cost, so this is not new to us.\\r\\nOur philosophy of balanced growth and profitability has not changed, and we will continue to be judicious with our expense structure while reinvesting in areas with the highest expected return and continuing to drive strong, consistent cash flow generation. We remain committed to managing the business towards the Rule of 40.\\r\\nWith respect to our financial outlook for 2023 due to continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain cautious with our outlook. However, we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remain intact, and we expect continued demand for Jamf\\'s innovative solutions.\\r\\nOur outlook assumes muted bookings growth for the first 6 to 9 months of the year due to macroeconomic conditions with improvements thereafter. We have also tightened our expectations around a beat and raise. We believe these factors, combined with cost containment measures, as described, will help us deliver on our outlook. \\r\\nAs such, our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023 is as follows: For the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $128.5 million to $130.5 million, representing growth of 19% to 21% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $3 million to $4 million. \\r\\nFor the full year 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $559 million to $563 million, representing growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $37.5 million to $40.5 million.\\r\\nAs we did in 2022, we anticipate non-GAAP operating income margins throughout 2023 as we continue to pursue cost initiatives. Additionally, while we don\\'t provide an ARR growth outlook, we anticipate our ARR growth rate and revenue growth rates will be similar in 2023.\\r\\nWe provide estimates for amortization, stock-based compensation-related payroll taxes and other metrics to assist with modeling in the earnings presentation as part of the webcast and also posted on our Investor Relations website.\\r\\nAnd now Dean, John and I will take your questions. Operator?\\n\\nQuestion and Answer Session\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham.\\n\\nJoshua Christopher Reilly\\n\\nAll right. Nice execution in a tough macro here. If you look at the macro, maybe can we get some more color on how much of a headwind is the slower customer expansions to growth this year? And can you just review in a typical year, how much growth or bookings is from expansions versus net new customers and how that might be different in 2023?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. Thanks a lot for joining us, Josh. Why don\\'t -- Ian, why don\\'t you grab that one?\\n\\nIan Goodkind\\n\\nYes, sure. Josh, good to hear from you. Yes, the macro environment is impacting us really on both fronts, right, on customer expansion and new logos bookings. We allocate resources where demand is strongest. And -- for example, we saw -- we had 2,000 new customers in Q4, and so we\\'re able to allocate resources that way. So really look at the combined portfolio. We did factor these macroeconomics into our guidance for the first 6 to 9 months as we\\'ve mentioned. \\r\\nAnd then in the fourth quarter of 2023, we have some increased bookings due to the returning of the economy. Long term, our fundamentals remain intact, and we expect our business to return as the economy returns.\\n\\nJoshua Christopher Reilly\\n\\nGot it. I think if I remember correctly, you guys have a pretty strong pipeline of education renewals here in 2023. Will these be renewed as 3-year deals again as they were in 2020? And how do you expect pricing to be relative to the original deal structure?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. So thanks for the question. Our largest renewal quarters for education are Q2 and Q3. In the U.S., June is the end of the fiscal year in education, of course, July being then beginning in the next fiscal year. As such, a lot of our buying in education was concentrated around those 2 months. And as a result, those are pretty high renewal months. It is quite common when a renewal is due within education that they may renew for 3 years. The reason for that is Apple will frequently provide leases to schools for devices for 3 years, and schools will just take the Jamf solution for the same 3 years for what their lease may be.\\r\\nSo I would expect a normal buying pattern this upcoming year. The one advantage that we have this upcoming year is this will be the first education buying season that we have the Jamf Safe Internet solution also now with support for Chromebook. So that\\'s going to allow us to have a significant sell back and hopefully grow some of those renewals by adding another solution into the mix.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes from Canaccord.\\n\\nDavid E. Hynes\\n\\nDean, maybe I can just pick up on that last thread, which maybe is a 2-part question on Safe Internet. So the value prop there seems pretty obvious to me, right? But it is nearly a doubling of the base Jamf school ASP, right? So I guess the question kind of gets that price sensitivity in the education space. I know it\\'s super early, but like any observations on attach rates at renewals? \\r\\nAnd I guess the second part of that question is just with the expansion of the Chromebook, how material is that in terms of TAM expansion for device count potential?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. Great question. And -- so first of all, just to give some specifics, you\\'re right that when we add Jamf Safe Internet into the mix, it\\'s -- I\\'ll call it about a 70% uplift on the price per device within education.\\r\\nHowever, we were priced -- have been priced attractively for that market. We feel we\\'re about right priced. Generally speaking, organizations or schools are going out there and buying their device management from one provider and their Internet filtering or Safe Internet from another provider. So by getting it all from Jamf, it\\'s actually advantageous to them financially. We mentioned in the first couple of quarters that there were 400 customers that selected it. That\\'s mostly from our base. So we\\'ve done a good job going back and upselling them.\\r\\nAnd you can imagine, when you launch a new solution, I mean, you start with no referenceability, no buzz. And so that builds over time. So us having some 400 new customers in the first 6 months, we\\'re pleased with that. And we just announced Jamf Safe Internet, gosh, I think yesterday. And we have already -- I\\'m already aware of a dozen or so sales of Jamf Safe Internet for Chromebook, which is what I meant by yesterday, has already been closed. So we\\'re pretty optimistic for the potential of that. \\r\\nAnd as you know, Chromebook is actually by market share, the large -- the most frequently used devices in American schools. And so it\\'s actually a pretty big uplift from a TAM perspective.\\n\\nDavid E. Hynes\\n\\nYes. Super helpful. The follow-up question, and it\\'s something I got asked by investors, so I figured I\\'d just put it out to you. But when Okta\\'s at work report came out, and just skip that competitive dynamics a bit, I got questions around Kandji\\'s growth, right? And granted, it was presented on a customer count bases, not user or devices. But can you just help investors kind of with where they\\'re positioned in the market versus Jamf? And how that might impact kind of the growth metrics we\\'re seeing in that report. Any competitive observations you\\'d make there?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nSure. And first of all, just to set the stage, that\\'s a report that\\'s been used for a number of years. Frankly, when Jamf was roughly the size of some of our competitive solutions, we were #1 growth company on that report every single year. We were proud to be so.\\r\\nIn that same report, it\\'s worth noting that Okta cites that Jamf has had a 428% customer growth over the last 4 years. And the words used in the report are that Jamf now is in the dominant position, having 3x as many customers as any other tools. So the combination of what that report had to say about Jamf\\'s dominance in the market and then also Kandji\\'s growth bodes pretty well the attractiveness of the Apple management space.\\r\\nSo we see it as a pretty positive sign for the market overall. But generally speaking, to answer your specific question, since Jamf runs 22 of the top 25 global companies, generally speaking, that means that Kandji and most competitors are going to attempt to come at Jamf from the lower end of the market.\\r\\nWith that said, the SMB market or really the S market of 100 to 1,000 employees, that commercially is actually Jamf\\'s fastest-growing segment right now. So we\\'ve been doing pretty well in that segment, despite there being new competitors in the space.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler.\\n\\nRobbie David Owens\\n\\nFirst off, just unpacking the Q1 guidance being down sequentially, I guess, even at the high end of the range. Help us understand what\\'s embedded in there? Is that a function of some of the churn that you guys have been talking about? Or maybe the mix you saw here in the fourth quarter with on-premise subscription? Just help us understand in a dominant subscription business why that might be down quarter-over-quarter.\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nWhy don\\'t I jump in here quick and I\\'ll kick it off to Ian. Your second comment there, Rob -- and thanks for the question, because it allows us to provide some clarity. You\\'re spot on there. It has more to do with the timing of some onetime revenue, that with commercial markets on just kind of how Q4 plays out from a timing perspective with some large on-premise deals. \\r\\nAnd by the way, on-premise for Jamf means anything other than our Jamf cloud. So there are some fairly large Jamf customers that run and I put in -- if you can see me there\\'d be quotation marks saying, \"on-premise\", which means they actually run in their own cloud, but we end up recognizing the revenue as on-premise revenue. And that did affect Q4 versus Q1 a little bit. Ian, do you want to chime in with any commentary on that?\\n\\nIan Goodkind\\n\\nYes, that\\'s right, Dean. I mean, it is really the on-prem. I mean remember, from a seasonality perspective, our Q4 is seasonally high from a commercial perspective, and Q1 is actually our lowest. So -- but if you looked at just the recurring revenue piece alone that excludes the on-prem, that is actually increasing. And so it really is some of that onetime revenue that makes it or distorts that number.\\n\\nRobbie David Owens\\n\\nGreat. And as a follow-up, have you seen any opportunity to shake loose from the VMware customer base? Or is that still much a wait and see as that acquisition isn\\'t done and maybe something that\\'s back half of this year, first half of next?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes, I think that as the market and customers get clarity on what\\'s going to happen there as that acquisition closes, I\\'ve been pretty open that I believe that\\'s going to create quite a large replacement market opportunity for us. And we did cite in our script, although we didn\\'t call out a competitor specifically, we cited out that with 1 organization, we had replaced 10 implementations in Q4 of greater than 1,000 devices. That\\'s the organization we were referring to. And I think that type of opportunity will grow as we proceed through 2023.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.\\n\\nRaimo Lenschow\\n\\nIf you think about the NRR number and slightly down ticking, you mentioned on the script that it\\'s based on people not buying as much new seat expansions. What are you seeing on renewals? Like, are thee -- is there also like a case of down renewals happening? And how long will that be a headwind for you as you go for the year? And then I have 1 follow-up.\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes, I didn\\'t -- I heard the bulk of your question, Raimo, until you\\'ve gotten to renewals, then you blanked out there for a second. Could you repeat that?\\n\\nRaimo Lenschow\\n\\nYes. Yes. So I was just wondering if you see anything around down renewals that -- as people have less employees, that there is like maybe on the renewal side that you have down renewals? And obviously, that could be a headwind as the year progresses as a different kind of cohort come up for renewal. Is there anything that you\\'re seeing there? Or is it really just the new -- or the customers not buying the expansions?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. And so one of the things that we found, and let\\'s face it, Jamf is actually very, very heavily used in the tech industry. And as you\\'ve seen, of course, tech has been rather active in the area of resource reductions of late. And a lot of the headline stories that you hear are from Jamf customers, of course, just because we run most companies within tech.\\r\\nBut what we have found is because tech also hired really, really heavily before some of that layoff activity, that to Jamf, it actually just looks like slower growth at renewal because they might have hired a lot of people, say, from the beginning of the year up through September, and then even if they did do layoffs, their head count is still higher than it was at their last renewal. So it isn\\'t like it doesn\\'t impact us, but it\\'s rarely down. For us, it just looks like slower growth. Does that make sense?\\n\\nRaimo Lenschow\\n\\nYes. Yes. No. Okay. Makes sense. And then if you think about the cost containment efforts that you have this year, like can you talk a little bit about -- I think your margins are coming up, by my math, about 200 bps. Is that like -- given all the kind of noise you made around controlling cost, controlling projects, it seems to me that there could be more room. But like -- maybe I\\'m missing something here. Can you expand on that, please?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. Why don\\'t -- Ian and I will kind of ham and egg that a little bit. First of all, yes, you\\'re right, we are -- do have a margin expansion of nearly 200 basis points. And this has been a part of our long-term plan. We had always planned on doing that. And just like Jamf has always said, we will grow our revenue responsibly. We will also grow our margins responsibly as well because we -- ultimately, if it wasn\\'t clear in the prepared remarks, we believe that the market is actually very attractive and actually getting more attractive for us, but we are in a short-term window of a macroeconomic challenge.\\r\\nAnd of course, we will expand margins within that window. Well, we believe on the other side of that is going to be great opportunity. So we do not want to sacrifice continued market share expansion for the long term because of a short-term macroeconomic challenge. Do you want to make more comments on that, Ian?\\n\\nIan Goodkind\\n\\nYes. What I would add there, too, just as a reminder, we talked about this in Q3 as well, we said, \"Hey, we\\'re not going to go and overpay and pay expensive talent.\" We actually did things we\\'ve commented on it earlier this year. So what -- earlier in 2022. And so those things bode well for us into -- as we go into 2023. You\\'ve heard we\\'re taking a look at all our big costs and making sure that we can manage them appropriately.\\r\\nWe\\'re not going to do anything knee-jerk that damage our long-term business, but we are increasing profitability to around that 7% number compared to the prior year. So we are taking steps. We\\'ve already taken steps, and it\\'s going to bode well for us long term. And it will help us achieve some of those long-term targets that we have out there.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC.\\n\\nMatthew George Hedberg\\n\\nIn 2022, it looked like the growth of both device adds and ARPU slowed on a year-on-year basis. And it looks based on kind of revenue and what you said ARR should grow similar to revenue, maybe about 17%. It looks like both device add and ARPU could -- growth could slow again in \\'23. I guess I\\'m wondering, between those 2 variables devices add and ARPU, which do you suspect will be the bigger driver of ARR growth in \\'23?\\n\\nIan Goodkind\\n\\nYes. Dean, I can go first and feel free to jump in. I mean, devices, we\\'ve talked about where our major growth is, right? It\\'s on upsell from additional devices. It\\'s been on new logos. And it\\'s really on the cross-sell.\\r\\nAnd on the device expansion, that\\'s where we\\'ve seen the biggest impact. That\\'s what we\\'ve factored in our guidance. But we have continued to see really good growth with new customers. Again, we had 2,000 here. And then -- on the security side, I just mentioned, we actually have 49% growth, right, year-over-year.\\r\\nNow that\\'s up to 20% of our portfolio. We have 13,500 customers on it. So that actually is -- we\\'re starting to build the muscle there, and we\\'re starting to gain momentum there.\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. And our -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our ARR per device has grown to $17 now. We expect that, that\\'s going to continue to expand, likely at a somewhat similar rate as it has been expanding. And as far as our device growth goes, of course, we\\'ll continue to grow. But I think our device growth will mirror what Ian talked about in his prepared remarks that the first half of this year will likely not look completely dissimilar to the last half of last year.\\r\\nBut as you look at the macroeconomic environment, there are some that believe that there will be a bit of a recovery in the latter half of this year, considering who our customers are and as we watch carefully those that are slowing down their hiring or even eliminating personnel, we think that it could have a positive impact on the latter half of the year when it comes to device growth, but we\\'re prepared to deliver on the bottom line even if that doesn\\'t happen.\\n\\nMatthew George Hedberg\\n\\nGot it. And then maybe just sort of as a dovetail to it and maybe just one other clarification on the guide. So just to be clear, you\\'re basically assuming that the first 9 months, fee has kind of muted pressure, but there\\'s some sort of economic recovery or buying recovery in kind of Q4 is sort of what the baseline assumption is?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. That\\'s basically the way that we\\'re approaching the year again, but anticipating that in the second half and therefore, wanting to be in a position to take advantage of that, but also being in a position to do what we need to do should that recovery not happen.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Matt Stotler from William Blair.\\n\\nMatthew Alan Stotler\\n\\nMaybe just one on kind of Mac device growth. I mean you mentioned the best device growth for Mac that you\\'ve seen in 2022, which was good to hear. Can you maybe just bifurcate the trends that you\\'re seeing? You mentioned a lot of the Mac by tier, maybe bifurcate between what you\\'re seeing with Mac and iOS, iPad OS, and any key differences there?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. So the iOS market for us is more of an existing market that doesn\\'t require the TAM to grow in order for us to grow. In other words, as you well know, we have a smaller share of the iOS market. So there\\'s more available for us to take. As a matter of fact, in John\\'s remarks where he talked about the 10 replacement deals that we had in Q4, 9 of those 10 deals were driven by iPad and iPhone. Now that wasn\\'t because of the iPad and iPhone growth, that was because it was replacement deal.\\r\\nThe Mac is different because we essentially run the majority of Macs that are out there. So our Mac growth generally comes with Mac market growth. And so we mentioned specifically that growth in devices as another proof point to what I had commented on earlier regarding our -- from our vantage point, we\\'re seeing just Mac market share rise. \\r\\nSo it\\'s a little bit more about being the leader in Mac and seeing that TAM rise versus an iOS having lower market share and it being more replacement opportunities that we\\'re winning. Does that make sense?\\n\\nMatthew Alan Stotler\\n\\nYes. No, that\\'s very helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the security product portfolio. Helpful the, I guess, attach rate there, right, between 13,000 and 14,000 customers. What are you seeing in terms of dollar penetration within those customers, right? Like as you think about number of security dollars spent per dollar management spend, I\\'d be interested to get your thoughts there. And then are you still seeing security deals as mostly been expansion deals? Or are you starting to see maybe security-led or bundled initial deals with those products?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes, I think that -- I\\'ll answer the second part of that first. Because Jamf is so established in the management space, that continues to be the easiest area to land for us. And so therefore, it is typically more of an organization looking at us for management and then expanding to security. And the way that we priced our solution is if you go with Jamf for management only, we are a premier solution in that space.\\r\\nBut if you go with Jamf for management and security, the price of the entire bundle ends up being very attractive compared to an organization needing to buy those solutions from multiple providers. I just read a win report of an example of a customer feeling pressure from a price perspective using Jamf for only management and rather than going out there and lowering our management fees, we actually raised the deal to include our security solutions and showing the customer that if they consolidated on a platform of Jamf, they could actually save money.\\r\\nAnd indeed, they did that. We had several of those types of deals in Q4. And frankly, that provides a whole new sales vector that Jamf has never had. Historically, we\\'ve been the point solution that\\'s competing with more platform players. All of a sudden, for Apple, we are the platform player. They\\'re going to have identity solutions, security solutions and management solutions, all is one price and save the customer money in the process.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\\n\\nGregg Steven Moskowitz\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll take the other side of Raimo\\'s question on margins. Dean, you mentioned that you expect 2023 head count as at or below current levels. But can you speak a little more to your confidence level that Jamf is properly positioned to reaccelerate later in 2023 or in 2024 once demand does improve?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nYes. If you go back -- thank you. It\\'s good to hear from you, Gregg. You can almost play Jamf\\'s last few earnings calls and each one builds on the next, right? If you go back a couple of quarters, we talked about the really tough employment market and getting enough of our quota-bearing reps on board, and how we specifically decided not to go out and overspend to bring QBRs on because we believe that the market was really getting skewed with too rapidly rising compensation plans for those reps, and we saw organizations overpaying for those.\\r\\nAnd we made that comment again in Q3, but we said we saw that the market was starting to be a little bit more attractive for employers later in the year, and we were going to take advantage at that time to bring sales reps on board so that we could be prepared by the beginning of this fiscal 2023 for the recovery that we talked about a little earlier that we expect could happen in Q4 of this year. \\r\\nAnd of course, it takes 6 to 9 months to properly wrap a wrap up to full productivity. So we started the year with the reps that we need in order to be fully ramped 9 months from now. Yet we dialed back spending everywhere else, which is why we were able to finish the year beating our free cash flow and our non-GAAP OI guidance.\\n\\nGregg Steven Moskowitz\\n\\nOkay. Terrific. And then just as a follow-up on another note, we heard that you recently implemented a price increase for Jamf. Can you walk through the rationale for the increase? And then also, what has the reaction been, the spark from customers?\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nSo thanks. We have -- one of the things we\\'re very proud of in 2022 is going into 2023, our competitiveness of our solutions are substantially better than entering into 2022 when they were excellent as well because we added a lot of new capability.\\r\\nLike, for instance, app installers as part of app catalog. We just announced a really attractive new feature called remote access built right into Jamf Pro. And the last time we\\'ve done a significant price increase on Jamf Pro was back in 2016. So customers do expect it occasionally. And when they\\'re getting much more value for the solution that they purchased, it\\'s something that they understand and move forward with. Thus far, we haven\\'t seen any significant blowback from it, and customers are renewing in 2023 as we would have expected.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda from Bank of America.\\n\\nKoji Ikeda\\n\\nI wanted to go back to a previous question and dig in a little bit more, and you actually mentioned it in the prepared remarks a couple of times too, about anticipated growth in the latter part of \\'23.\\r\\nI guess the question is, are you hearing it from customers too? And if you are, about this anticipated growth, maybe you could talk a little bit about sort of size of customer or a certain specific type of customer where customers are talking about, \"Hey, get ready for the second half.\" And that\\'s actually contributing to your kind of outlook of this anticipated growth later this year.\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nWell, if you take a look at, for instance, I used an example earlier of just tech. Clearly, as we approach through the fall, there were a fair number of hiring freezes and resource reductions that occurred in tech. Well, for those of us that have been in tech for a lot of years, we know that tech is very elastic in terms of responding quickly to market changes. And so lapping what happened this fall or a year later next year. I think most of those tech organizations, and as we speak to our customers, I think they\\'re anticipating that they\\'ll be in more of a normal hiring environment later in the year.\\r\\nNow nobody can predict the future perfectly, which is why we say that we will both be ready with ramped reps should that employment market come back to a little bit more of a normal environment. But we will also be ready in managing our costs to deliver on the bottom line that we\\'re committed to, even if that doesn\\'t occur.\\n\\nIan Goodkind\\n\\nDean, maybe I\\'ll just answer one other thing on there, add one thing. On the SMB side, right, we talked about our marks to the fastest to move and there have just been a little bit of volatility. But even aggregately in the first quarter, we\\'ve talked to some of our sales folks. They\\'ve talked about some customers already coming back from the standpoint, \"Hey, we tried something that we thought was cheaper, but we found it didn\\'t have the functionality, and we have a comeback.\" \\r\\nAnd we\\'ve had some of those discussions as well. But to Dean\\'s point, we\\'ve built an elastic model where we\\'ll be able to prove improvements, hire throughout the year and deliver on those results throughout the year.\\n\\nKoji Ikeda\\n\\nGot it. That\\'s super helpful. And just one follow-up here. I wanted to ask about free cash flow generation. I know you guys don\\'t guide to it, you guys to operating margins. But when I look at the past 2 years, fiscal \\'22 operating margins of 5%, 70% free cash flow margins; 2021 operating margins of 6%, free cash flow margins of 15%; and you just guided to 7% operating margin. So just how should we be thinking about free cash flow generation in 2023? Is there anything we should be really thinking about that could alter that type of cadence?\\n\\nIan Goodkind\\n\\nYes. Thanks for the question. I think you\\'re thinking about it right. As our operating margin goes up, we would expect our unlevered free cash flow margin to go up at similar rates for 2023. But what I thought was (inaudible) about seasonality, right?\\r\\nQuarter 1 is typically our low mark -- low-water mark. And so you should expect we have year-end payments, we did have some increased collections this year. So that will impact Q1, but you\\'ll see that increase throughout the year, similar to what we\\'re guiding from GAAP operating income standpoint.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThis does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\\'s program. I\\'d like to turn the program back to Dean Hager for any further remarks.\\n\\nDean J. Hager\\n\\nThank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We feel great at Jamf about completing a tough 2022 with outstanding top line and bottom line results.\\r\\nAs we look forward to 2023, we believe that our products are stronger than when we entered in 2022, we believe our competitiveness is better than when we entered 2022. We see opportunities that are very unique to 2023 in front of us, and we plan to expand our profitability, continue to grow, and most important for our long-term future, continue to win market share.\\r\\nAs we -- and that will put us in an excellent position to capitalize on an improving macroeconomic environment in the future when it comes back to us. So thank you very much. Have a great evening, and we appreciate you following us.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.'"
